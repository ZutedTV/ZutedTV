👋 Hi there! I’m @ZutedTV

👀 I’m interested in: Crafting immersive gaming experiences through code. My passion lies in creating custom scripts and mods for games like Minecraft and FiveM to enhance gameplay and engage players.

🌱 I’m currently learning: Advanced Java development techniques for Minecraft plugins and diving deeper into Lua scripting for FiveM servers to push the boundaries of game customization.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on:
- Minecraft plugin development
- FiveM roleplay scripts or server optimization
- Game development projects requiring Java or Lua expertise

⚡ Fun fact: My love for gaming sparked my journey into programming, and now I turn ideas into in-game realities. Whether it's creating a unique FiveM script or a new Minecraft mechanic, I'm always up for the challenge!
